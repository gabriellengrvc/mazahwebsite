Food waste is a significant issue globally, with approximately one-third of all food produced going to waste. Here are some key statistics to consider:

- **Global Impact**: Food waste contributes to about 8-10% of greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Economic Cost**: The economic cost of food waste is estimated at $940 billion annually.
- **Household Waste**: In the U.S., 30-40% of the food supply is wasted, with households being the largest contributors.

By understanding these statistics, we can take action to reduce food waste and its impact on the environment.
